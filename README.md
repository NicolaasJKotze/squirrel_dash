# Squirrel Dash
A gamejam learning GODOT, GIT, Agile, and art. Also a little something to demo at work, Meetups, and maybe schools to get kids interested.

# The MVP for the game is:
The PLAYER must control the squirrel to collect acorns in a hurry before winter comes and beat their previous score.

Climbing trees, hiding behind bushes, day-night, foxes, owls, eagles, stamina, using acorns as weapons, moving trees, carry acorns, storing acorns, power-ups, pooping, teasing, etc, are all added "bugs" and will be included as development goes.
